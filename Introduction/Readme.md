<span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold">Python </span> is a **interpreted** language developed by **Guido Van Rossum** in 1991. It has easy to learn syntax and is powerful at the same time, which makes it a very good choice for early birds to step into the 🌏 world of coding 💝.

## What is **Interpreted** language ?  
A interpreted language is executed line by line at the runtime, rather being compiled to machine code before execution. When you run your **Python** code, the interpreter reads your code one line at a time and executes it directly.Which makes it slower then **compiled** language

examples of interperated language:
* python
* javascript
* bash
* R
* Lua
* Matlab

## What is **Compiled** language ? 
A code written in **compiled** language is converted to binary code before the program is executed. **Compiled** code are way performent then interperated languages. Which makes them good choice for complex sinarios like game engine.

examples of compiled languages:
* C
* C++
* Rust
* Kotlin
