<span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold">Python </span> is a **interpreted** language developed by **Guido Van Rossum** in 1991. It has easy to learn syntax and is powerful at the same time, which makes it a very good choice for early birds to step into the 🌏 world of coding 💝.

## What is **Interpreted** language ?  
A interpreted language is executed line by line at the runtime, rather being compiled to machine code before execution. When you run your **Python** code, the interpreter reads your code one line at a time and executes it directly.Which makes it slower then **compiled** language

examples of interperated language:
* python
* javascript
* bash
* R
* Lua
* Matlab

## What is **Compiled** language ? 
A code written in **compiled** language is converted to binary code before the program is executed. **Compiled** code are way performent then interperated languages. Which makes them good choice for complex sinarios like game engine.

examples of compiled languages:
* C
* C++
* Rust
* Kotlin
* etc

## Where python is used in real life ? 
In real life **python** is used in verity of places,
and it is a backbone to many applications you intract with on your day to day life. I'll list some examples category wise, which will show you how **versatile** 
the language is even being **easy** and **flexiable**.

* **Web Dev**
    > Being versatile and easy many brands uses python frameworks like django and flask (<- will be covered in this course) to develop the server side code of their application.
    * instagram
    * spotify
    * pintrest
    * The Washington post
    * Udemy
    * etc
* **Data Science, ML & AI**
  > I love AI and to many brands use framework like **pytorch** and **tensorflow** to fuel their ambitions like self driving car, recommending your next song, video, dress
    * recommendation in Netflix
    * NVIDIA
    * Qualcomm
    * Google
    * Apple
    * etc
* **Software Development**
  * Blender
* **Desktop GUIs**
  * spotify desktop client

I think this is enough to energize you to learn python.
In this chapter we will install and setup **python**, and a **code editor**, and only output something on the screen.
* **python**
  * To install python go to <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">python's website</a> (👈🏻 🔗) or if you are using windows you can also go to 🪟 store and search **python** and download the latest version.
* **code editor**
  * There are 2 code editors which I love **1. <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/">pycharm</a>** and **2. <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">vs code</a>** (👈🏻 available on 🪟 store )
